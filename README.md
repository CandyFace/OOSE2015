# Slick2D Eclipse OOSE2015 Project - Asteroids

A recreaton of the old arcade Asteroids game with hopefully additional features.
This project is a part of OOSE2015 AAU Medialogy Cph.

The game features so far:
- Player movement with rotation
- An asteroid which can fly and rotate

The hopefully game will feature:
- A working variant of the Asteroid game
- Score and lives
- Particles, because particles makes everything better..
- Sound effects and titlescreen


Interesting additions but most likely not happening:
- Network gameplay
